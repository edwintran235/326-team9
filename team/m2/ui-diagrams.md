**Use Case**


The profile page will include a picture of the user, a description/bio, their resume, contact information, and user settings.

## User Applications Screen

The **User Application Screen** is the homepage that users will be directed to after logging in. It includes all of the users current applications, interviews, offers, and to-dos which will be organized into four columns. The job names that fall under each category will be listed, each with a link to the **Notes** page with more information on that job. There is a navigation bar at the top where users can be directed to the **Profile Page** or the **Login Page** after logging out. There are buttons for adding new applications which will be filled out in a pop-up.

On this screen, users can interact with their applications:

1. **Prioritize Applications**: The user has the ability to order the applications so that the user can view the most important ones first.
2. **Create New Applications**: The user can click the "+" button to add new applications.
3. **Change Status**: The user can drag and drop their applications into different stages (i.e. TO-DO -> Applied -> Interview -> Offer)
4. **Rejected Applications**: If a user is rejected at any point in the application process, they can drag and drop it over the trash can icon. This will store the failed application elsewhere.
5. **View More Info**: If a user wants more details on a job that they have applied for, they can click the application/job title and it will direct them to the **Application Information Screen** for that job.

This screen is the primary location for the user’s experience. It includes links to all other important pages. It acts as the main display for the Job Application Tracker as well as a directory for other useful features.

**Use Case**: 

A user who wants to track the progress of their Job/Interview processes would log into the application to see a list of the Jobs that they have applied for. When a user hears back from the company that they have reached the interview process, the user can tack this by dragging the application to the interview column. Anytime the user views this page, they will be reminded that they have an interview coming up.

## Application Information Screen

The **Application Information** is for users to view more information about a job, how to apply, application requirements, status, and history.

The form also includes input validation to ensure that all required fields are completed before submission. If any required fields are missing, the user will receive an error message prompting them to correct the issue.

**Use Case**: 

A user who just paid for groceries would navigate to this screen, select “Groceries” from the category dropdown, enter the amount spent, and optionally add a note such as “Weekly shopping.” After saving the expense, the user is taken back to the **Main Dashboard** where the total for the month is updated to reflect the newly logged transaction.
