This screen is the primary location for the user’s experience. It includes links to all other important pages. It acts as the main display for the Job Application Tracker as well as a directory for other useful features.

**Use Case**: 

A user who wants to track the progress of their Job/Interview processes would log into the application to see a list of the Jobs that they are applying for. This list will include status information, deadlines, notifications, and priorities. If a user notices that they have not yet applied for a desired job and the deadline is quickly approaching, they can decide to start working on their application in order to submit on time.

## Application Information Screen

The **Application Information** is for users to view more information about a job, how to apply, application requirements, status, and history.

The form also includes input validation to ensure that all required fields are completed before submission. If any required fields are missing, the user will receive an error message prompting them to correct the issue.

**Use Case**: 

A user who just paid for groceries would navigate to this screen, select “Groceries” from the category dropdown, enter the amount spent, and optionally add a note such as “Weekly shopping.” After saving the expense, the user is taken back to the **Main Dashboard** where the total for the month is updated to reflect the newly logged transaction.
