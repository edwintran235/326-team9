# UI Diagrams

## Login Page Screen

The **Login Page** is the landing page when initially loaded. Here, the users must log in or create an account in order to access the homepage and interact with our system. This page is simple with two inputs for username and password and our logo.

![Login Page Placeholder](...)

**Use Case**:

The user wants to track their job application process by using our service. In order to use our service, they must log in. The user sets a username and password the first time that they log in. After logging in, the user will land on the **User Applications Screen** where they can interact with our service. All of the user's interactions are saved under the user's profile, so that every time they log in their information is there.

## Profile Page Screen

The **Profile Page** is where users can enter their information. This information will be important in other features

![Profile Page Placeholder](...)

The profile page will include a picture of the user, a description/bio, their resume, contact information, and user settings. The user has the opportunity to edit any of this information after it is saved.

**Use Case**:

A user who just logged in wants to personalize their account. When they go to the profile page, they can edit their name, biography, contact information, user settings, and upload a resume. Say the user just got married and wants to change their name. The user can edit their profile, input a new name, and save their changes. The user's new name will show on their profile.

## User Applications Screen

The **User Application Screen** is the homepage that users will be directed to after logging in. It includes all of the users current applications, interviews, offers, and to-dos which will be organized into four columns. The job names that fall under each category will be listed, each with a link to the **Notes** page with more information on that job. There is a navigation bar at the top where users can be directed to the **Profile Page** or the **Login Page** after logging out. There are buttons for adding new applications which will be filled out in a pop-up.

![User Applications Placeholder](...)

On this screen, users can interact with their applications:

1. **Prioritize Applications**: The user has the ability to order the applications so that the user can view the most important ones first.
2. **Create New Applications**: The user can click the "+" button to add new applications.
3. **Change Status**: The user can drag and drop their applications into different stages (i.e. TO-DO -> Applied -> Interview -> Offer)
4. **Rejected Applications**: If a user is rejected at any point in the application process, they can drag and drop it over the trash can icon. This will store the failed application elsewhere.
5. **View More Info**: If a user wants more details on a job that they have applied for, they can click the application/job title and it will direct them to the **Application Information Screen** for that job.

This screen is the primary location for the userâ€™s experience. It includes links to all other important pages. It acts as the main display for the Job Application Tracker as well as a directory for other useful features.

**Use Case**: 

A user who wants to track the progress of their Job/Interview processes would log into the application to see a list of the Jobs that they have applied for. When a user hears back from the company that they have reached the interview process, the user can tack this by dragging the application to the interview column. Anytime the user views this page, they will be reminded that they have an interview coming up.
